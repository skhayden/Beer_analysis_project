There are over 5300 breweries in the US with 800 opening last year as stated in the article “U.S. Breweries Top 5,300 as Craft Beer Makers Ride Double-Digit Gains.” from NPR.  We want to know does bitterness of a beer go up as alcohol levels go up? We will use the data provide by our client and R software to conduct our analyses. \n\n#Gathering data \nThe first R script combines the two files provide together. It does this by storing the two files as data frames and then cleaning data, so it can be joined on brewery Id. \n\n```{r echo=TRUE}\nsetwd(getwd()) \n\n#runs script to clean data and merge the data the brewery logistics and beer characteristics data together.\nsource(\"C:/Users/shayden/Documents/GitHub/SMU/Doing_Data_Science_1/CaseStudy/Beer analysis project/analysis/Data/Beer_data_Cleaner.R\")\n```\n\n#Data \nThe data contains current characteristics of beers and their breweries across the United States. There are 558 breweries sampled and 2410 beers associated with those breweries. R is used to clean the data, put the data into a usable format, create and store function, and present the data in a readable form. Sample of data in output below. \n```{r echo=TRUE}\nstr(beer_brew_merge)\n```\n\n\nThe second R script is where all the analyses takes place. The median ABV and IBU by state are calculated in this scrip along with their respected max. This is where the relationship between ABV and IBU is identified as well. All these calculated objects will be later used to present the findings in a more readable way, such as graphs. \n\n```{r echo=TRUE}\n#runs script to Report the number of NA's in each column.\n#Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state.\n#Finds the state with the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer.\n#Finds the state with the most bitter beer (IBU).\n#analysis the relationship between ABV and IBU and stores it into the regressor varible. \nsource(\"C:/Users/shayden/Documents/GitHub/SMU/Doing_Data_Science_1/CaseStudy/Beer analysis project/analysis/Analysis_of_beer.R\")\n```\n\n\n```{r echo=TRUE}\nsummary(beer_brew_merge$ABV, na.rm = TRUE)\n```\n\n\n\n```{r echo=TRUE}\n#sets margins for graph\n\npar(mar=c(5, 3, 4.1, 0), mgp=c(3, 1, 0), las=2)\n#generates graph\nbarplot( ABV_IBU_Median$ABV_Median,col=c(\"darkblue\"),space = 1,\n     main=\"ABV Median vs State\", # Title\n     xlab=\"ABV Median\" ,         # xaxis label \n     names.arg = ABV_IBU_Median$State,\n     cex.names =.5,    #size of axis font\n     las =1)           #Horizontal axis \n   \n\n\n#sets margins for graph\npar(mar=c(5, 3, 4.1, 0), mgp=c(3, 1, 0), las=2)\n#generates graph\nbarplot( ABV_IBU_Median$IBU_Median,col=c(\"red\"),space = 1,\n         main=\"IBU Median vs State\", # Title\n         xlab=\"IBU Median\",          # xaxis label \n         names.arg = ABV_IBU_Median$State,\n        cex.names =.5,    #size of axis font\n        las =1)           #Horizontal axis )\n\n```\n\n#Relationship between bitterness and alcohol\n```{r echo=TRUE}\n# 7. Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic\n\n\n\n\n#import data\n\n\n\ndf1 = data.frame(beer_brew_merge, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n#ggplot\n#install.packages(\"ggplot2\",dependencies = TRUE)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(aes(x= df1$ABV, y= df1$IBU),\n             colour='red', na.rm = TRUE,size = .75)+\n  geom_line(aes(x= df1$ABV,y= predict(regressor, newdata = df1 )),\n            colour='blue',na.rm = TRUE)+\n  ggtitle('ABV vs IBU')+\n  xlab('ABV')+\n  ylab('IBU')\n\n\n\n# Yes there is a linear correlation between alcholol content and the bitterness of the beer\n# as the alcholol content increases and the bitterness of the beer also increases.\n\n#----Done---\n\n```\n#Conclusion\n```{r echo=TRUE}\nsummary(regressor)\n```\n\nThe relationship between ABV and IBU is a positive linear relationship. With a T Value of 33.86  and p-value of 2.2e -6.  There is strong evidence to support that there is a positive relationship. The next question to further investigate is consumer preference. Do consumers like beer that is less bitter? If so, production time may be shorted by creating a beer with less alcohol. If you have any question or concerns, please feel free to reach out to use through our Git Hub repository. \nThank you,\nSteven Hayden, Thejas Prasad\n\n##Bibliography\nChapple, Bill. “U.S. Breweries Top 5,300 As Craft Beer Makers Ride Double-Digit Gains.” The two-Way BREAKING NEWS FROM NPR, 28 Mar. 2016, 1:06pm, www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/28/521797352/u-s-breweries-top-5-300-as-craft-beer-makers-ride-double-digit-gains.\n",
